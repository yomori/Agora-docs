# Density/velocity shells

## Density shells
Density shells are produced by projecting all the particles in a given distance (in increments of 25 Mpc/$h$), onto a HEALPix map of $N_{\rm side}$=8192.

This is taved in one big tar:

```agora_density.tar```

which can be extracted using 
```bash
tar xvf agora_density.tar
```

There files have naming convention that look like:
```
mdpl2_density_${shellnum}_${chilower}_${chiupper}.fits
```
where ```shellnum``` is the shell number, and ```chilower/chiupper``` are the upper and lower distances for a given shell in units of ${\rm Mpc}/h$. The maps themselves represent the number of particles that fall inside each pixel. An overdensity map can be generated by taking:

$$
\delta_{\rm DM}=\frac{\rho_{\rm DM}-\bar{\rho}_{\rm DM}}{ \bar{\rho}_{\rm DM}}
$$

## Velocity shells

The velocity shells are saved in a similar manner as the density shells. It is stored as a big tar:<BR>
```mdpl2_vlos.tar```

which can be extracted using 
```bash
tar xvf mdpl2_velocity.tar
```

There files have naming convention that look like:
```
mdpl2_vlos_${shellnum}_${chilower}_${chiupper}.fits
```
where the naming convention is the same as the density field.
The maps themselves represent the average velocity of all the particles that fall inside each pixel divided by the angular diameter distance squared $d_{A}^{2}$ in units of ${\rm km/s}$.
