# Galaxy lensing 

Galaxy weak lensing can be found in

```globus: components/galaxylensing/```

In this directory there are three subdirectories

```/desy1```
```/desy3```
```/lssty1```

which correspond to DES-Y1, DES-Y3 and LSST-Y1 shear products. Inside each of these folders,
there are further diretires:

```/cat```
```/maps```
```/nz```


---------------------------------------
# n(z)

The n(z) used to create galaxy catalogues/maps are stored in these directories.
There are n files corresponding to the n redshift bins considered.
Each file has two columns z and n(z). Note: the z spacing depends on where the n(z) came from, and is therefore file dependent.


---------------------------------------
# Maps

These are signal-only maps.

These maps are effectively generated by stacking raytraced lenisng maps weighting the shells:
$$
\kappa(p) = \sum_{z=0}^{z=8.6} k(p,z) n(z) dz
$$
using the redshift distribution in the the ```nz``` directory.


---------------------------------------
# Catalogs

These are signal+noise catalogs.

These maps are effectively generated by stacking raytraced lenisng maps weighting the shells:
$$
\kappa(p) = \sum_{z=0}^{z=8.6} k(p,z) n(z) dz
$$
using the redshift distribution in the the ```nz``` directory
